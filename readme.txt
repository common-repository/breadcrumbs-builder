== Description ==

#### Breadcrumb Builder

Breadcrumb is an amazing tool to make the navigation on your site more convenient. Add a breadcrumb navigation bar to your site and watch your way to the last page/post you have visited on your site. This means you can see the order of the pages/posts you have passed until you reached the last visited one. 


#### Main Features:

* Themes - There are 5 themes available for the breadcrumb navigation bar. 
* You're here title - You can decide whether to add or not "You're here" text before your tabs. You can also change the text and type anything you wish!
* Show on home page - If you don't want the navigation bar appear on your homepage, you can simply uncheck the option and the bar will appear on all your pages except for home page!
* Home tab - Decide and select whether you wish to display the home page via icon, a little house, via text, "Home", or maybe you want to display both, the icon and the text. 
* Alignment - Customize the alignment of the box. Add pixels to your bar from the Top, Right, Bottom and Left sides of your page.
* Position on the page - You can choose the position of the bar on your pages
 * Primary header
 * Secondary header
 * Before or After the content
 * Primary footer or Secondary footer

Images are shown to make it easier for you to pick the position!
